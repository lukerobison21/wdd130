    <p>    I'm a computer science major and I hope to get a job in programming, so far 
        I'm not too picky about what field.  I'm taking this class because I 
        want to learn more about how the websites we all use and take for granted
        work.  I'm a little interested in web design as a career but I don't know 
        enough at the moment to say for sure.<p>

    <p>  I'm from Buffalo, New York and I'm a huge Bills fan.  I like most sports 
        and I really enjoy snowboarding.  I'm excited to see what they have here in 
        Rexburg<p>
    <p>   I served a mission in Layton, Ut Spanish-speaking and returned last July.  
        I love the gospel and it has changed my life.   I  devloped a powerful 
        relationship with my Savior that I hope to continue to use in my personal, 
        family, and professional life.</p>
