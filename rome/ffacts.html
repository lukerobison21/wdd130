        <p id="bro">Rome, often called the "Eternal City," is a treasure trove of fascinating facts that highlight its rich history and cultural significance. Founded in 753 BCE, legend has it that the city was established by twin brothers Romulus and Remus, who were raised by a she-wolf. Rome boasts a continuous history of over 2,500 years, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe. The city is home to the Colosseum, an iconic amphitheater that could hold up to 50,000 spectators for gladiatorial games and other spectacles. Ancient Romans were engineering pioneers; their aqueducts brought fresh water to the city from miles away, some of which are still functional today.
            The Pantheon, an architectural marvel with a massive dome and an open oculus at its center, was built nearly 2,000 years ago and remains one of the best-preserved Roman structures. Did you know that modern-day Roman roads often follow the routes laid down by the Romans over two millennia ago? The phrase “All roads lead to Rome” stems from this network. Rome also houses Vatican City, the smallest country in the world and the spiritual hub for millions of Catholics. From its legendary history to its remarkable architecture, Rome continues to captivate the world.

                <h1>SPQR</h1>
                <p>stands for Senatus Populusque Romanus, which translates to "The Senate and the People of Rome." It was a symbol of the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire, representing the collective authority and unity of the Senate and the Roman citizens. Widely used in inscriptions, coins, monuments, and official documents, SPQR epitomized the republican ideals of shared governance and civic duty. The abbreviation became a hallmark of Rome's influence, reminding both its citizens and conquered territories of Roman power and identity. Today, SPQR remains a significant emblem of Roman history, culture, and legacy, often associated with the grandeur and governance of ancient Rome.</p>
