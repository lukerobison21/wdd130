      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I’m a computer science major so I love technology and the future, but I also have a huge interest in the past.  The past parallels the future and can be our best map to predict the future.  I especially love Roman history.  The rise and fall of their republic and later their empire is a great example of how to build a stable society and how such a society can fall.  They’ve had such an impact on our nation.  The Eagle we use as a symbol comes from the Romans who used it as the symbol of their legions.  My website will aim to provide information such as this to those who want it concisely and accurately while providing images and primary sources to back this up.

        The Roman Empire, one of history's most influential civilizations, has left a profound and enduring legacy on the modern world. At its height, it spanned Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East, encompassing diverse cultures while fostering advancements in governance, law, engineering, and culture. Roman law, especially the principles of justice, equality, and due process, laid the foundation for many contemporary legal systems, influencing the structure of courts and constitutions globally. The Republic's governance model, characterized by a Senate and checks on power, inspired modern democratic frameworks, including the U.S. Constitution. Architecturally, the Romans revolutionized construction with the invention of concrete, enabling the creation of enduring structures like aqueducts, amphitheaters, and roads, many of which still stand today. This innovation set the stage for modern urban planning and infrastructure. Latin, the language of Rome, became the bedrock of Romance languages like Spanish, French, and Italian and contributed significantly to English vocabulary. Roman literature, philosophy, and art continue to inspire cultural and intellectual pursuits, while their adoption of Christianity helped shape Western religious traditions. The empire's emphasis on trade and connectivity fostered economic integration, much like globalization today. Even Roman military strategies and tactics remain subjects of study. Despite its fall, the Roman Empire's achievements are a testament to human ingenuity and ambition, profoundly shaping the modern world's political, legal, cultural, and architectural landscapes. Its legacy reminds us of the enduring power of innovation, cultural exchange, and governance.

      <h3>Parallels</h3>
      <p>
        The United States and the Roman Republic share striking parallels in their political structures, cultural values, and historical trajectories. Both emerged as republics, prioritizing civic participation, checks and balances, and rule of law. The Roman Republic had a Senate and elected officials like consuls, mirroring the U.S. system of a bicameral Congress and the presidency. Both civilizations placed great emphasis on patriotism, civic duty, and the protection of individual rights within a structured legal framework. Militarily, both have demonstrated significant global influence, with Rome expanding its empire across the Mediterranean and the U.S. maintaining a far-reaching presence through its alliances and interventions.
Culturally, both nations have celebrated innovation, adaptability, and leadership. Rome's integration of diverse peoples and cultures has parallels in America's identity as a "melting pot." Additionally, both experienced debates over the balance of power between central authority and local autonomy. However, the transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire—a shift from a republic to autocratic rule—has served as a historical lesson about the potential fragility of democratic systems.
By studying Rome’s rise and fall, the United States can reflect on its challenges, from political division to the preservation of republican ideals, underscoring the importance of sustaining democracy and civic engagement in a rapidly changing world.

      <h3>Fun Facts</h3>
      <p>
        Rome, often called the "Eternal City," is a treasure trove of fascinating facts that highlight its rich history and cultural significance. Founded in 753 BCE, legend has it that the city was established by twin brothers Romulus and Remus, who were raised by a she-wolf. Rome boasts a continuous history of over 2,500 years, making it one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe. The city is home to the Colosseum, an iconic amphitheater that could hold up to 50,000 spectators for gladiatorial games and other spectacles. Ancient Romans were engineering pioneers; their aqueducts brought fresh water to the city from miles away, some of which are still functional today.
The Pantheon, an architectural marvel with a massive dome and an open oculus at its center, was built nearly 2,000 years ago and remains one of the best-preserved Roman structures. Did you know that modern-day Roman roads often follow the routes laid down by the Romans over two millennia ago? The phrase “All roads lead to Rome” stems from this network. Rome also houses Vatican City, the smallest country in the world and the spiritual hub for millions of Catholics. From its legendary history to its remarkable architecture, Rome continues to captivate the world.
